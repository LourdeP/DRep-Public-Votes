    "comment": "     Much thought process went behind this vote after many  instances of listening to the various opinions of the community as well as the experts I have found that a balance must be met. The voting mechanisms built here are utilized to help further the blockchain with full concern about the community and the effects of said votes. As with many others within the ecosystem as a whole I have doubts and apprehensions about the Constitution and some of the excluded and unexplained portions that remain ambiguous. \nThose that are seated currently as interim members of specialized positions are the bearers of the weight of community expectations primarily the budget. \n   I unabashedly covet  what has been built and I find value in understanding that we as a community are now in a moment of experimentation, where the mechanisms built for governance must now be enacted and utilized by the community to make the changes in which so many have stated must be considered and enforced. \n   With reluctance and  hesitation I have decided to vote \"Yes \"for the current constitutional draft ,my reasoning is that \"WE\" the community have the mechanisms set up to make the changes, it is now in our hands as a community to show not only each other but the entire world of blockchain that governance can be done \"RIGHT\"  by the people for the people with the future communities in mind....  barring greed, grabs for power, grandstanding and political angst.\n I have more confidence within the community than the words written within the Constitution itself. It is time for us to get the ball rolling and prove that we as a community can find balance for those awaiting their opportunity to join us.\n\n~LOURDE~\nOuroborus\nImperator\nAeternalis "
